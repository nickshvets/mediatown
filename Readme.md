# README for MediaTown

## _Personal Media management tool_

MediaTown is a React and TypeScript application that provides a dynamic platform for managing a variety of media types such as movies, TV shows, and games. The application uses a mock JSON server to simulate data storage and retrieval, making it an excellent tool for both development and demonstration purposes.

## Demo

## Features

- CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete media entries.
- Search Functionality: Filter through the media list with ease.
- Custom Validation Rules: Ensures data integrity during creation or editing of media entries.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for a seamless experience across various devices.

## Getting Started

Clone the project

`git clone git@github.com:nickshvetsdev/mediatown.git`

Install all the necessary packages

`npm install`

Navigate to the `/api` folder:

`cd api`

Start the JSON server:

`npm start:api` -> This command starts the backend server which listens for API requests.

In a separate console, or a separate tab in the root directory of the project, run:

`npm run start:web`
